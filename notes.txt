One of the ways to solve circular dependancies is to move the 
offending module(import) to the bottom. 

@app.route() -> decorator allows assignment of more than on url to a view function

add top level script that represents the application will be microblog.py

---

since there are no users yet, to build a new app with feature which doesnt exist,
use dummy variables/users/data to build base of the feature. 

-- using jinja2, both {{user.username}}, {{user['username']}} works. 

flask apps configs can be done as keys in app.config[''] ways
or to enforce the principle of 'seperation of concerns', 
using a slighly more elaborate structure, keep configs in a seperate file. 
--its extensible using python class to store configs
--seperate module gives better organization of files
-- this way cann add/remove configs,
--if more than one config set, can create subclasses. 

- Flask and some of its extensions use secret key as a cryptographic key,
 useful to generate signatures or tokens, 
 -wtf uses it to protect forms against CSRF (seasurf)
 cross site request forgery

-----
The novalidate attribute tells the web browser to not apply validation 
to the fields in this form, leaving this task to the Flask application running in the server.

-- .hidden_tag generates hidden field that has token to protect against CSRF

-- forms can have more than one validators so form.fieldname.errors will be a list. #

--better to use url_for()
-URLs more likely to change than view functions, 
-some URLs have dynamic component in them, so will have to concat strings
this is a test tio check the new keyboard hf hf sd 

DATABASE:

flask migrate is used to help migrate old data to new structure when 
the structure of the database changes, as application grows and changes. 

flask-sqlalchem doesnt do this , but only hlps in creation and updating of datadase. 
supports 
--sqlite, a small file base database, postgress and sql. 
can use sqlite for dev and and on production server can switch to postgres without making changes. ?? nice 

to tell flask type and location of database 
add var to config file --  

'sqlite:// [hostname]-> sqlite:/// 
third / is to skip the hostname to tell locally stored file  

-track modification - to tell flask how to behave everytime models/object changes, if its 
not given clear instructions, it'll throw errors, so set to False for now. 

---
Add index=True for search. 
relations dbs do search well if data is indexed.

-- Migration 
to take db as python object and initialise the migration framework(repo) to maintain db 
flask init db

after migration repo, do first migration 
flask db migrate -m 'description'

this migration hasnt been done to db yet. 
flask db history, current gives relevant info of migrations. 

db.ForeignKey('user.id') -- represents authorship of the Post table 

backref='author' -> adds author attribute to Post model, so as to access post.author 
to give user instance, 

lazy = dynamic --> makes posts attribute a query instead of list of posts 
this will allows adding(qualifiers) more filters, sorting and other actions on posts

Flask-login

manages user logged in state, remembers logged in state when user navigates to diff pages,
'remember_me' feature when browser is closed. 

it works with apps User model and expects certain properties, methods to be implemented. 
requires 4 items. 'check blog'

These are also provided by flask-login, by a 
UserMixin class, for safe implementation for most user model classes. 


flask-login passes ID as string so convert to int for any db that use int IDs. 

*********
User Profile 

create hash with md5, 
use http://gravatar.com/avatar/hash to render image
default if not set. can set size. 

-----

seperate blog post into sub templates since its used by other templates
--better to start sub templates with _ (underscore)

********
-- to add last_seen, keep track when a user is logged in/requests a page on all routes, 
--better way to DRY is.. using before_request handler, 
-- the logic that involves to all the routes can be included in this function

--- db.session.commit() -- directly committing here without .add()  
since user object is already loaded in the session when the user logs in 
and the flask_login function invokes the user loader function to load it from  
the id that is stored in the user session. 

************

Edit user details :

Length(min=0, max=140) -> min =0 makes about_me optional.
