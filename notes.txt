One of the ways to solve circular dependancies is to move the 
offending module(import) to the bottom. 

@app.route() -> decorator allows assignment of more than on url to a view function

add top level script that represents the application will be microblog.py

since there are no users yet, to build a new app with feature which doesnt exist,
use dummy variables/users/data to build base of the feature. 

-- using jinja2, both {{user.username}}, {{user['username']}} works.
